 Millions of people worldwide face the grim prospect of hunger daily, lacking access to sufficient nutritious food.
<br><br>


Have you ever wondered when your next meal might be? Can you imagine the agony of watching your children suffer from hunger? When was the last time you experienced the pang of going days without food? <br><br>

For countless individuals around the world, these scenarios are not hypothetical—they are a daily struggle. <br><br>

The pain is tangible, and the rewards for alleviating it are immense. <br><br>

###### The Prophet Muhammad ﷺ was once asked, "What is the best part of Islam?" He responded, "Feeding the hungry and extending greetings to both acquaintances and strangers." <br><br>
