 Around one in every ten people globally lacks access to clean water, an essential resource for drinking, sanitation, hygiene, and agriculture. In many regions, entire communities depend on water for their daily survival.

Women and girls are particularly impacted by the water crisis, often bearing the responsibility of water collection. This labor-intensive task limits their opportunities for education and work, perpetuating the cycle of poverty. Moreover, water-related diseases claim nearly one million lives annually, with children facing the greatest risks, which affects their school attendance and education prospects.

Providing safe water is crucial—it can be the difference between life and death. At Care and Relief Foundation, we envision a world where no one lives in poverty, and ensuring access to clean water is fundamental to this vision.

##### Care and Relief Foundation's Water Initiatives


Our Water, Sanitation, and Hygiene (WASH) programs focus on revitalizing community infrastructure through innovative solutions like solar-powered water systems and educational campaigns on sanitation best practices. We're committed to helping vulnerable communities forge a sustainable future.

##### Key initiatives include:

* Enhancing water access and hygiene education to mitigate the spread of waterborne illnesses in remote areas of Pakistan. <br> <br>

* Developing resilient WASH infrastructure to support both potable and agricultural water needs in Tharparkar and surrounding regions.<br> <br>

* Elevating WASH standards for displaced populations and returnees by upgrading hand pumps, sanitation facilities, and providing hygiene kits tailored for women and girls in critical areas of Pakistan.
