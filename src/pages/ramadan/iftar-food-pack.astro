                </h4>
                  <p class="subtitle">
                    Ramadan is a month that teaches empathy and selflessness. Fasting allows individuals to experience the struggles of those who go hungry daily. However, for families already grappling with poverty, fasting becomes even more challenging when they lack the means to prepare an adequate Iftar packs meal.


                  </p>
                  
                 
                  <!-- <p class="subtitle">
                    In addition to these benefits, contributing to charity
                    through Sadaqah also plays a crucial role in fostering a
                    sense of unity and community. The act of giving, rooted in
                    the principles of generosity and compassion, not only
                    positively impacts individuals in need but also strengthens
                    the bond among members of society.
