                    In Pakistan, 1,400 beneficiaries received winter kits and food packs, while in Gaza, 5,000 individuals were supported with vital winter essentials. In the UK, more than 500 individuals received critical winter support to help them survive the cold. Closer to home, our volunteers distributed hot meals and warm blankets to the homeless, ensuring that no one in the UK faced the winter without comfort.
